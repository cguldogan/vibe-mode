# Vibe Mode

A VS Code extension that helps you enter your optimal coding flow state by intelligently managing your workspace layout for maximum focus and productivity.

## Features

This extension provides commands to optimize your VS Code layout for deep focus work:

### Primary Commands

- **Vibe On** (`vibe-mode.vibeOn`) - Enter your flow state with optimal layout configuration
- **Vibe Off** (`vibe-mode.vibeOff`) - Exit flow state and restore default VS Code layout

## What Vibe Mode Does

### Vibe On - Enter Flow State
- Automatically cleans conflicting UI elements
- Opens Copilot chat in editor for AI assistance  
- Moves terminal to left for better workflow
- Hides sidebar and activity bar for maximum focus
- Smart conflict detection and resolution

### Vibe Off - Exit Flow State
- Restores activity bar to default position (visible, left)
- Moves panel/terminal back to bottom position
- Shows sidebar and normal UI elements
- Opens chat in normal sidebar/panel mode
- Creates new empty editor in center
- Ensures status bar is visible

## Enhanced Layout Conflict Resolution

This extension includes enhanced logic to resolve layout conflicts that can occur when multiple editors, Welcome tabs, or other UI elements compete for space with your focused workflow.

### Automatic Conflict Detection
- Detects Welcome tabs that conflict with optimal layout
- Identifies multiple open editors that create clutter
- Recognizes when sidebar and panels interfere with focus

### Aggressive Cleanup Strategy
- Closes all conflicting editors before entering Vibe Mode
- Hides sidebar, activity bar, and unnecessary panels
- Provides a clean slate for optimal focus and flow
- Includes comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

### Usage

### Quick Setup - Enter Vibe Mode
Run the **"Vibe Mode: Vibe On - Enter Flow State"** command from the Command Palette to enter your optimal coding flow state with automatic conflict resolution.

### Exit Vibe Mode  
Run the **"Vibe Mode: Vibe Off - Exit Flow State"** command to restore the default VS Code layout when you're done with focused work.

### Commands
- **"Vibe Mode: Vibe On - Enter Flow State"** - Complete flow state optimization  
- **"Vibe Mode: Vibe Off - Exit Flow State"** - Restore default VS Code layout

## Technical Details

### Flow State Optimization Strategy
1. **Clean Slate Approach**: Closes all conflicting editors and tabs
2. **UI Minimization**: Hides non-essential UI elements (sidebar, activity bar, panels)
3. **Terminal Optimization**: Positions terminal on the left for better workflow
4. **Focus Integration**: Opens tools (like Copilot) in the optimal editor position

### Conflict Resolution
The extension detects and resolves common layout conflicts:
- Multiple open editors competing for space
- Welcome tab interfering with focused workflow
- Sidebar and activity bar reducing available space
- Bottom panels creating visual clutter

### Commands Used
- `workbench.action.chat.openInEditor` - Opens Copilot in editor mode
- `workbench.action.positionPanelLeft` - Moves terminal to left
- `workbench.action.closeSidebar` - Hides the sidebar
- `workbench.action.activityBarLocation.hide` - Hides the activity bar
- `workbench.action.closeAllEditors` - Cleans up conflicting editors

## Requirements

- VS Code version 1.74.0 or higher
- GitHub Copilot extension (recommended for AI-assisted coding workflows)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the folder in VS Code
3. Press `F5` to run the extension in a new Extension Development Host window
4. Use the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) to access the commands

## Extension Commands

This extension contributes the following commands:

- `vibe-mode.vibeOn`: Vibe On - Enter Flow State (with conflict resolution)
- `vibe-mode.vibeOff`: Vibe Off - Exit Flow State (restore default layout)

## Known Issues and Limitations

- Requires GitHub Copilot extension to be installed for AI-assisted workflows
- Some VS Code commands may not be available in all environments
- Layout changes are immediate and can be reversed using Vibe Off command

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1
- Initial release with basic layout management
- Commands for focused workflow, terminal, and sidebar management
- Comprehensive test suite

### 0.1.0 (Current - Vibe Mode)

## Testing

This extension includes comprehensive automated tests to ensure reliability and functionality.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests (54 tests total)
npm test

# Run tests with watch mode during development
npm run watch

# Compile and lint before testing
npm run pretest
```

### Test Structure

The extension includes five types of tests:

1. **Unit Tests** (`src/test/extension.test.ts`) - Test individual functions and command registration with mocking
2. **Integration Tests** (`src/test/integration.test.ts`) - Test extension activation and command availability in VS Code environment

- **Component State Tracking**: Monitors all layout components (panel position, sidebar visibility, Copilot status)  
- **Command Sequence Verification**: Ensures the correct VS Code commands are called in proper order
- **Fallback Behavior**: Tests that alternative commands work when primary commands fail
- **State Persistence**: Verifies layout changes persist and are reflected in VS Code configuration
- **Configuration Validation**: Tests that layout configuration values are correctly set and accessible
- **Real Environment Testing**: All tests run in actual VS Code instance with real command execution
